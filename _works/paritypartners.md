        <h3>Company Background</h3>
        <p>
          Parity Partners is a “for profit, for good” company dedicated to building the next generation of women in leaderships positions through advocacy, education, and recruitment.
          Founded in 2016, Parity Partners has grown exponentially since its inception; increasing its membership from 300 members in its first year to 600 members, currently.
          Through their Parity Professional Program (P3), they hope to foster a network of women who will champion efforts for increased diversity, inclusion and equity within venture capital and technology industries.
        </p>
        <h3>Business Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The below competitive matrix represents the relationship of each direct competitor, specializing in women’s professional development, relative to Parity Partners.
          The x-axis represents the emphasis each company’s business model places on social networking and/or professional development while the y-axis represents how inclusive of exclusion the organization is based upon admission criteria, membership fees, and niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the below matrix, our team discovered that Parity Partners provided a more exclusion experience for members which focused mainly on professional development.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/projects/paritypartners/compet.png"/>
        <p>
          Our team conducted a competitive feature analysis to determine the strengths and weaknesses of Parity Partner’s competitors in order to strategize ways that will provide Parity Partners with a distinct advantage and address barriers that may hinder Parity Partners growth within this market.
          Our team completed an initial scan of each website to identify features for this assessment: membership fees, professional meetings, social events, member meetings, online events, free workshops, job boards, articles, podcasts, video, career coaching, and donation buttons.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/projects/paritypartners/competitiveFeatures.png"/>
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>
          Five interviews were conducted with members of the P3 to better uncover their preferences for engagement with professional development programming, their motivations for joining and continuing membership in the P3 program, and to identify areas for improvement for their member experience.
          Upon completion of the interviews, our team synthesized the results in order to identify pattens in the responses to help guide our recommendations.
          These insights are below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users engage with a mix of online and offline professional development content, with a preference for offline content (i.e. meeting, events)
          </li>
          <li>
            Users would like to develop community within pods through shared experience, goals, and professional development life stages
          </li>
          <li>
            Users identified that pod leaders who are engaged, dedicated and serve as mentors to the group make them feel more encouraged
          </li>
          <li>
            Clarity around the selection criteria for both the P3 admissions process and P3 pods would increase member compatibility and retention within pods
          </li>
          <li>
            Users would like the to accomplish shared goals within their pod meetings
          </li>
          <li>
            Users become frustrated with complicated scheduling and inconsistent attendance within pods
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The patterned findings listed above will help inform Parity Partners and our UX design team in order to amplify successful aspects of the program and find ways to reduce user pain points.

        <h3>Research to Design</h3>
        <p>
          Our team synthesized our research into themes, which were then re-structured as “I” statements humanize our findings.
          The “I” statements were then connected to potential features to ensure our team was designing to fulfill the user’s needs.

        <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <p>
          Our team did one round of a design studio with the staff of Parity Partners to generate ideas about features to solve the problem at hand.
          Then we synthesized the results from our first round of design studio by creating a feature prioritization list for each page of the flow.
          They are organized into the categories of Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have.
        </p>
        <div class="double">

        <h3>Key Performance Indicators</h3>
        <p>
          Our design team used Key Performance indicators, a type of success metric, to allow us to understand how well the P3 website will perform over time.

        <h3>Application Programming Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
          The website for Parity Partners utilizes several APIs related to social media, database management, geolocation services, and calendarizing events. The following APIs should be considered when developing the platform.

        <h3>Design Recommendations</h3>
        <p>
          Through our research, we’ve identified multiple routes for Parity Partners to improve the experience of the program for both members and staff.
          Our recommendations are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Streamline scheduling process for pod meetings for members</li>
          <li>Incorporate member’s self-selection of pods to join by interest</li>
          <li>Develop members feedback mechanism into platform after meetings to track engagement</li>
          <li>Increase engagement on the website by highlighting successful pods and events</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          For the member flow and the leader flow, our team conducted three rounds of usability tests with five users each round.
          Round one and two were conducted while using mid-fidelity wireframes.
          Round 3 was conducted while using high-fidelity wireframes.
          After each round of testing, our team came together to re-iterate on the designs based on the user feedback from testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are the results of each round of testing:

        <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>
          Our research found multiple avenues in which we can enrich and improve upon Parity Partners’ online site for the P3 program in order to create a cohesive digital ecosystem for their pod members.
          To meet this goal, we propose the following recommendations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Streamline the process for joining and paying for a pod through the pod self-selection process</li>
          <li>Create filter options for pod members to find suitable pods based on their availability, interest or location</li>
          <li>Integrate payment options to complete the process to join a pod</li>
          <li>Improve the visibility of pod members, leaders by creating linkages on profile images</li>
          <li>Create profiles with calendar to enable optimal meeting time support</li>
          <li>Add functionality for direct individual and group messages</li>
          <li>Streamline the onboarding process for pod leaders through instructional video content and a knowledge check (quiz) to activate pod membership</li>
          <li>Provide functionality for pod leaders to create events with optimal meeting times for pod members</li>
          <li>Increase engagement on the website by simplifying the event review for pods and pod leaders</li>
          <li>Develop administrative dashboard to track KPIs, member payment tracking, and resource database</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After testing and iterations, we created our hi-fi prototype. Check it out and see if you can complete the tasks!

        <p>
          Overall, we believe that the above recommendations will provide a positive return of investment on Parity Partners’ P3 experience, resulting increased streamlined orientation processes, increased use of P3 websites, and ultimately higher member satisfaction for members, leaders and staff.
