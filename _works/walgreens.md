    <h1>The Feature Brief</h1>
    <p>
      Walgreen's responsive website is in need of some restructuring.
      They are examining different ways to organize their information online and make it more like the in-store experience.

        <h3>Company Background</h3>
        <p>
          Walgreens is the second-largest pharmacy store chain in the United States behind CVS Health.
          It specializes in filling prescriptions, health and wellness products, health information, and photo services.
          The first Walgreens opened in Dixon, Illinois in 1901 and expanded to Chicago and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walgreens exists to provide trusted care in communities around the country.
          They strive to meet their customers’ needs and improve their health through constant exploration.
          The company has a history of making great innovation to meet its customers’ needs and improve their health.
          For example, they were the first company to use child-resistant containers in the 1960s and today they have created a 5-star rated mobile app to meet their customers’ needs.
        </p>
        <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p>
          My team and I went to Walgreens to see how people journey through the store. We spoke to five shoppers who were not familiar with the web experience. After observing the shoppers and asking some questions, we uncovered the following insights:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All shoppers were shopping for something specific, but also decided to do some browsing</li>
          <li>Shoppers compared items based on price and value</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Feature Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          From there, we moved onto conducting a competitive feature analysis. Based on Walgreens’ product selection and services mentioned by shoppers in our contextual inquiries, we identified a few of Walgreen’s competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we hypothesized, Walgreens was lacking a few features that their competitors had, while having many of the same business goals.
        </p>
        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          We then decided to conduct a heuristic evaluation on the existing site in order to identify problem areas and potential pain points for users.
        </p>

        <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
        <p>
          We then conducted two rounds of card sorting in order to hone in on the navigation/category issues and see how our users would categorize Walgreens products and services.
        </p>
        <div class="double">
          <div>
            <img src="/assets/projects/walgreens/card1.jpg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="/assets/projects/walgreens/card2.jpg">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Through card sorting, we learned that the top categories into which users were sorting Walgreens’ products were pharmacy, shop, and photo.
        </p>
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, we conducted usability testing of Walgreens existing website, which confirmed many of our original assumptions. That the site is very busy and users are unsure where to find what they are looking for. This is a stark difference from the store where users are quick to find what they are looking for and can spend more time on comparing prices of similar items.

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          After all the research, the following problem statement emerged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How might we match the fluidity of an in-store experience to a digital e-commerce experience in order to make purchasing items online faster and more natural.</strong>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Design</h3>
        <p>
          My research helped me identify and narrow down the main pain points users were experiencing on Walgreens’ website. I then ideated key features and aspects to implement in my redesign that would directly address the following pain points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Finding items quickly</li>
          <li>Comparing items while visiting other parts of the website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I created mid-fidelity wireframes to communicate my ideas and conducted two rounds of usability testing to evaluate the effectiveness of my features. A few key screens, along with annotations, of my latest designs are shown below.

          <div>
            <img class="screen" src="/assets/projects/walgreens/screen2.jpg"/>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img class="screen" src="/assets/projects/walgreens/screen3.jpg"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Overall, I really enjoyed working on Walgreens’ web redesign. As for next steps, I would like to improve on the prototype and create and offline version of the website to further improve the testability of the compare feature as well as improve the delightfulness of the website.
