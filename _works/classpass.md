    <h1>The Feature Brief</h1>
    <p>
      ClassPass is looking to increase class bookings by its members to build a stronger community. They are exploring ways their users can motivate friends and family members to take a class together to increase social engagement on the platform.

        <h3>Screener Survey</h3>
        <p>
          My team and I initially put together a list of questions to send out in order to identify people who would be able to provide us with meaningful insight into their exercise habits. From this we identified 10 users to interview.
        </p>
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          Mentioned above, 10 user interviews were conducted in a 2:1 setting. Interviewees were asked questions by one team member while another, off to the side, took notes. Interviews were also recorded to pull direct quotes later. The most important questions were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What motivates you to work out?</li>
          <li>How do you feel other people play a role in your workouts?</li>
          <li>How does price affect your workout/fitness habits?</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          From the interviews we created an affinity map to better understand each interview from a wide perspective. After creating this affinity map, we were able to identify key insights including the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users like to be part of a community</li>
          <li>Users are concerned about the balance between value & price</li>
          <li>Users have better results with direction</li>
          <li>Users want to avoid distraction</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/assets/projects/classpass/map2.jpg">
        <img src="/assets/projects/classpass/map.jpg">
        <p>
          We now had a good idea of our users’ behaviors, and in being able to identify these patterns in our users, we began thinking about our two personas, Alice and Chester.
        </p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>
          Pulling insights from mapping out the interviews my team and I created two personas to represent who we would design for. They are Alice, the workout guru, and Chester, the workout newbie.
        </p>
        <div class="double">
          <div>
          <p>
            Shared goals:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Being around others who were conscious of good exercise habits</li>
            <li>Find great value from a great price</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Shared frustrations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Difficulty finding motivation alone</li>
              <li>Expensive upfront costs of gym memberships</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Being much more informed about our users, and after creating our personas, we were able to identify to redefine our problem statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>People who workout want to grow their community and find a support system. How might we incentivize users to connect with others and provide workout support and motivation for each other?</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2 style="color:{{ page.brand-color }}">Develop and Ideate</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Design Studio</h3>
        <p>
          With a strong idea of our personas, we moved into design studio. Design studio is a great way to collaborate and share ideas in a team setting. We did two rounds of design studio, focusing on each of our personas. We presented our ideas to the team and picked out what we felt were the “best” ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design studio was fun and a great way to get our creative juices flowing. We really began thinking about how we could solve the “problem” set forth through app features. The top features included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassPass communities</li>
          <li>Rewards for achievements</li>
          <li>Titles for reaching milestones</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <p>
          Taking these features, we outlined what a minimum viable product would look like for a potential release
          To help with this process we created a feature prioritization matrix and outlined features that we must have, should have, could have, and won’t have.
        </p>
        <h3>Initial Design</h3>
        <p>
          Our team then moved to create some initial wireframes to detail out where the new features would fit into the current app.

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          With a good idea of the features we were moving forward with (those that fell under must have categories) we created mid-fidelity wireframes and conducted six usability tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testers were asked to complete a few tasks within our prototype:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check how many members are in the team and find who was least recently active</li>
          <li>Send send a message to the community members</li>
          <li>Share a class with your community</li>
          <li>Claim the reward for your first achievement, then check to see how many more classes you need to attend to receive your next credit reward</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="double">
          <div>
            <p>
              All users were able to complete the tasks with varying timing however as they thought aloud they provided insights into how easy the tasks were. Key findings include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>5/6 users thought rewards and achievements had a challenging flow</li>
              <li>5/6 users were unable to understand what the status bar on community page did</li>
              <li>4/6 users understood purpose of chat feature</li>
              <li>4/6 users thought that the community page encouraged social engagement</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              From this and other insights we created a list of changes to make to the prototype:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Included ability to leave the team (common question among Users)</li>
              <li>Changed the chat notification to a number (dot wasn’t noticeable enough for users)</li>
              <li>Included team admin identification icon (Users wanted notification of who the team creator was)</li>
              <li>Removed split banner with an image (Users did not know what this was)</li>
              <li>Replaced ClassPass’s share icon with alternate icon (Icon did not fit with users traditional take on share icon)</li>
              <li>Replaced original share pop-up with a new format (User had difficulty visualizing the flow)</li>
              <li>Removed rewards feature (does not fit within our ‘social engagement’ objective)</li>
              <li>Replace members bar with a segmented control bar (Number of members was not clear enough)</li>
              <li>Updated the status bar information (Majority of users were not able to understand concept)</li>
              <li>Created competition option (Added for social/motivation aspect)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another round of testing was conducted with five testers with new tasks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check how many members are in the team and find who was least recently active</li>
          <li>Send send a message to the community members</li>
          <li>Check what and when your upcoming class is supposed to be</li>
          <li>Share a class with your community</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We collected similar insights from the first round and created a new list of changes to make:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Change “community” to “team”</li>
          <li>Provide quick description/guidelines of “team” and information on levels</li>
          <li>Option to browse/create team</li>
          <li>Confirmation that class has been shared</li>
          <li>Make ‘leave community’ button smaller</li>
          <li>Specifying competition reward</li>
          <li>Specify how many competitions a team can join</li>
          <li>Swap past/upcoming on profile page</li>
          <li>Move share icon to ClassPass’s original location on class page screen</li>
          <li>Class page — visual that you already booked that class</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          After these rounds of testing and iterations, we created our hi-fi prototype. Check it out and see if you can complete the  tasks!

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          Our next steps are to conduct another round of testing using our high-fidelity prototype and move through defining both user and business goals. After this we’d like to contact ClassPass and share our insights with their product team.
