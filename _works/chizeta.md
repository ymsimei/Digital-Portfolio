        <h3>Organization Background</h3>
        <p>
          Alpha Kappa Psi (ΑΚΨ) is the oldest and largest professional business fraternity to current date. Also known as "AKPsi", the fraternity was founded on October 5, 1904, at New York University, and was incorporated on May 20, 1905. It is currently headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.
        </p>
        <p>
          The local chapter being established is named Chi Zeta. Its founding class is made up from students in multiple fields of study who all attend NJIT and have a passion for business development.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals of the Project</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deliver a website that contains information about the local chapter
          </li>
          <li>
            Design a layout that looks great on any screen
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Initial Design</h3>

          This first iteration was made to include a few key features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Show what the brotherhood was up to with news posts as well as any upcoming networking events
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell the story of Chi Zeta from the brother's perspective
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This design would be left on the cutting room floor as new ideas were brought up and different features were prioritized.

        <h3>Starting from Scratch</h3>
        <p>
          The site was hand-coded by myself with the source code available on my GitHub. The stack used is simply a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I decided to use Jekyll for some of the repeated code such as the navigation as well as for easy access to a SASS compiler to clean up the site styles.
