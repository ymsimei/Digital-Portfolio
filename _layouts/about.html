          ...Granted this was something I said back in highschool but I think you get the point.

          I am currently studying Human-Computer Interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
          For about a year now I have been doing research in a UX Lab where I have learned more about the iterative design process and research methods.
          I hope to work in a team where I can both learn from others and make big differences for others.

          When I am not working on projects, school work, and being involved in campus organizations, I can be found hanging out with friends and family.
          In my spare time I enjoy photography, geocaching, and gaming.

          Thank you for stopping by and I hope we can get in touch soon!
