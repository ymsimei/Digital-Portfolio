  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Myself and two others were tasked with building a new feature into ClassPass’s mobile app. For those unaware, ClassPass is a fitness membership that allows its users to choose from a wide variety of gyms and studios, ranging from yoga/pilates to spin classes. Users spend in-app credits in order to book classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project, I took on the roles of User Researcher and Interface Designer.
  </p>

  <h2>Screener Survey</h2>
  <p>
    My group and I initially put together a list of questions to send out in order to identify people who would be able to provide us with meaningful insight into their exercise habits. The key questions from that survey included how many people they worked out with and how often. From this we identified 10 users to interview prior to feature ideation.
  </p>
  <h2>The Feature Brief</h2>
  <p>
    ClassPass is looking to increase class bookings by its members to build a stronger community. They are exploring ways their users can motivate friends and family members to take a class together to increase social engagement on the platform.
  </p>
  <h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users should be able to communicate directly with other members on the platform</li>
    <li>Users should be able to propose workouts to other members</li>
    <li>Users should be able to book a workout and share their schedule with other members</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With these things in mind, we were now able to focus on moving forward with our user research.
  </p>
  <h2>User Interviews</h2>
  <p>
    Mentioned above, 10 user interviews were conducted in a 2:1 setting. Interviewees were asked questions by one team member while another off to the side took notes. Interviews were also recorded to pull direct quotes later. Many different questions were asked but the most important questions that pull the deepest insights were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What motivates you to work out?</li>
    <li>How do you feel other people play a role in your workouts?</li>
    <li>How does price affect your workout/fitness habits?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From the interviews we created an affinity map to better understand each interview from a wide perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    After creating this affinity map, we were able to identify key insights including the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users like to be part of a community</li>
    <li>Users are concerned about the balance between value & price</li>
    <li>Users have better results with direction</li>
    <li>Users want to avoid distraction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We now had a good idea of our users’ behaviors, and in being able to identify these patterns in our users, we began thinking about our two personas.
  </p>
  <h2>Personas</h2>
  <p>
    Pulling insights from mapping out the interviews my group and I created two personas to represent who we would design for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shared goals amongst these two include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Being around others who were conscious of good exercise habits</li>
    <li>Find great value from a great price</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Shared frustrations include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Difficulty finding motivation alone</li>
    <li>Expensive upfront costs of gym memberships</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Redefining Our Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Being much more informed about our users, and after creating our personas, we were able to identify to redefine our problem statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    People who workout want to grow their community and find a support system. How might we incentivize users to connect with others and provide workout support and motivation for each other?
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <p>
    With a strong idea of our personas, we moved into design studio. Design studio is a great way to collaborate and share ideas in a group setting. We did two rounds of design studio, focusing on each of our personas. We presented our ideas to the group and picked out what we felt were the “best” ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design studio was fun and a great way to get our creative juices flowing. We really began thinking about how we could solve the “problem” set forth through app features. The top features included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ClassPass Communities</li>
    <li>Rewards for achievements</li>
    <li>Titles for reaching milestones</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Taking these features, we outlined what a minimum viable product would look like for a potential release. To help with this process we created a feature prioritization matrix and outlined features that we must have, should have, could have, and won’t have.
  </p>
  <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
  <p>
    With a good idea of the features we were moving forward with (those that fell under must have categories) we created mid-fidelity wireframes and conducted six usability tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Testers were asked to complete a few tasks within our prototype.
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 1: Go to your community and check how many members are in the group and find who was least recently active
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 2: Send send a message to the community members
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 3: Share a class with your community
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 4: Claim the reward for your first achievement, then check to see how many more classes you need to attend to receive your next credit reward
  </p>
  <p>
    All users were able to complete the tasks with varying timing however as they thought aloud they provided insights into how easy the tasks were. Key findings include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>5/6 users thought rewards and achievements had a challenging flow</li>
    <li>5/6 users were unable to understand what the status bar on community page did</li>
    <li>4/6 users understood purpose of chat feature</li>
    <li>4/6 users thought that the community page encouraged social engagement</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From this and other insights we created a list of changes to make to the prototype:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Included ability to leave the group (common question among Users)</li>
    <li>Changed the chat notification to a number (dot wasn’t noticeable enough for users)</li>
    <li>Included group admin identification icon (Users wanted notification of who the group creator was)</li>
    <li>Removed split banner with an image (Users did not know what this was)</li>
    <li>Replaced ClassPass’s share icon with alternate icon (Icon did not fit with users traditional take on share icon)</li>
    <li>Replaced original share pop-up with a new format (User had difficulty visualizing the flow)</li>
    <li>Removed rewards feature (does not fit within our ‘social engagement’ objective)</li>
    <li>Replace members bar with a segmented control bar (Number of members was not clear enough)</li>
    <li>Updated the status bar information (Majority of users were not able to understand concept)</li>
    <li>Created competition option (Added for social/motivation aspect)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Another round of testing was conducted with five testers with new tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 1: Go to your community and check how many members are in the group and find who was least recently active
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 2: Send send a message to the community members
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 3: Check what and when your upcoming class is supposed to be
  </p>
  <p>
    Task 4: Share your upcoming class with your community
  </p>
  <p>
    We collected similar insights from the first round and created a new list of changes to make:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change “community” to “team”</li>
    <li>Provide quick description/guidelines of “team” and information on levels</li>
    <li>Option to browse/create team</li>
    <li>Confirmation that class has been shared</li>
    <li>Make ‘leave community’ button smaller</li>
    <li>Specifying competition reward</li>
    <li>Specify how many competitions a team can join</li>
    <li>Swap past/upcoming on profile page</li>
    <li>Move share icon to ClassPass’s original location on class page screen</li>
    <li>Class page — visual that you already booked that class</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    After these rounds of testing and iterations, we created our hi-fi prototype. Check it out and see if you can complete the four tasks.
  </p>
  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    Our next steps would be to conduct another round of testing using our high-fidelity prototype and move through defining both user and business goals. After this we’d like to contact ClassPass and share our insights with their product team.
